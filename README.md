## Repurposed U-Net Segmentation for Road Surface Detection

Experiments with preprocessing images to better identify features, leading to better segmentation results.

First attempt is through smoothed gradients, but success is/was fleeting...

Original DNN U-Net model based on an implementation by [nikhilroxtomar](https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/UNet-Segmentation-in-Keras-TensorFlow) which is in turn based on the 2015 paper:
